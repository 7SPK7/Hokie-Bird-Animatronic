<h1>LETS GOOOOOOO</h1>

Plan for Design changes

<h2>HEAD TEAM</h2>
Design for eyes is in the works
working on a mechanism to tilt the head

<h2>BODY TEAM</h2>
Working on a tail mechanism
working on how to twist the body (legs cannot move)

<h4>ECE TEAM GOALS ???</h4>
figure out how to drive the motors on the body twist with an arduino.       
We're going to need to figure out how to design a power distibution system for the bird.

we need to figure out how we're going to power the hokie bird with a plug probably running through the legs and the base. 

we need to pick the correct motors for the bird and hopefully minimize the required gear ratios
